Simulation of different types of cells
TODO: optimize time cycle
There are three types cell's:
1) Green. They're a 'plants' or mushroom. They get energy using photosynthesis. When theese cells get enough energy, they create seeds (or spores), which fly in the wind, gradually sinking. A seed falling to the ground forms a new plant.
2) Yellow. This plant-eating herbivore escapes predators.
3) Red. Predators, hunt herbivores.
